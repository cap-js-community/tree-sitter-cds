# tree-sitter-cds tools

This directory contains tools for tree-sitter-cds development.

## Docker

As generation of the grammar file depends on the tree-sitter version and
possibly some other details, we provide a Dockerfile that you can use to
create / update the grammar.

For usage, see [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile).
